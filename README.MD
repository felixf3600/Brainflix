# Brainflix Project

## Description

This is a mock up for a video site.

## Technologies

For this project I am using:

### API calls

I am using Axios to make calls and get up to date information from the site

### State

i am using state to keep track of changes in Reach JS

### SASS

with the combination of flexbox and BEM naming convention.

### React JS

To structure the DOM and use its ability to restructure on the fly without changing the whole DOM

### node

To install the required components such as react

### BEM

To make the naming convention easier to understand and follow.

### Mobile first responsive design

## Issues while working on this

Had to rework my React code a couple of times as I found issues with the structure as I switched from mobile to tablet and then to desktop. specially when switching to desktop and having the video list take part of the space of the video description.
